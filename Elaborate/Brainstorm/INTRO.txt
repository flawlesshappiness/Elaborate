"Listen, I've got a lot of shit going on right now. [Rent] is due so please hand it in."

"What, you don't have it?"
"Ugh, [The State] is gonna rip me a new one..."
"Suppose you could solve [this issue] for me, and I'll figure something out with your rent"
"Otherwise we're both dead meat"

> The State
"Yeah, The State, the one above"
"Big brother, high lord, large man"
"You know..."
(Suppose you could...)

> this issue
"Look, don't tell anyone in the building about this..."
"We've got a problem. A big one. The size of a rat. A big rat."
"You get the idea. The key to the basement is in the drawer next to my bed."

"Are we clear of [the rats] yet?"

> the rats
(We've got a problem...)
